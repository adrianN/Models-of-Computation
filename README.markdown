Lecture notes for Models of Computation 
====

As I did last semester in [Optimization](http://github.com/adrianN/Optimisation-SS10-UdS) I will publish my lecture notes here. 

The usual caveats apply:

* Don't believe what you read here
* Correct me if I'm wrong
* Give me chocolate if my notes were helpful

Contribute

If you want to contribute, send me your github account ID so that I can add you. You can of course also send me patches or images or just an email with a correction. I **especially appreciate images**
