Lecture notes for Models of Computation 
====

As last Semester in [Optimization](http://github.com/adrianN/Optimisation-SS10-UdS) I will publish my lecture notes here. 

The usual caveats apply:

* Don't believe what you read here
* Correct me if I'm wrong
* Give me chocolate if my notes were helpful
