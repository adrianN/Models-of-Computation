\subsection{Sorting by Distribution Sort}

We will do repeated $d$-way splitting ($d$ will be fixed later) until we have subproblems of size $\leq N/P$. Problems of that size are solved by a single processor.

For a problem of size $S$ a single processor needs 

\[O(\frac SB \cdot \log_{M/B}\frac SB \leq \frac SB \log_{M/B} \frac{N}{PB})\]

we use all $P$ processors in parallel to solve the leaf problems. In total that needs 

\[O(\frac{N}{PB} \log_{M/B} \frac{N}{PB})\]

IOs. For splitting we choose pivots as described in section \ldots, i.e. choosing $Cd\log N$ elements randomly, sort (on one processor -- choose $d$ sufficiently small), and take every $C\log N$-th element. We need to bound the number of splits. Assume the maximal size of a bucket is $x\cdot N/d$. We split for the following amount of rounds:

\[\log_{d/x} \frac{N}{N/P} = \frac{\log P}{\log d/x} \stackrel{{d\geq x^2}}{\leq} 2\frac{\log P}{\log d}\]

Recall the remark about partitioning $s_i$. Here we do the same to split the buckts. We allot $p_i$ processors such that

\[\frac{s_i}{p_i} \lqq \frac NP, \qquad p_i = \]

Then 

\[\sum p_i \leq \sum_i (\frac{s_iP}{N +1}) \leq 2P\]

And since the bound for partitioning applies and each round has cost 

\[O(\frac{N}{PB} + d\log P)\]

we get:

\begin{thm} The total cost is 

\[O(\frac{N}{PB} \log _{M/B} \frac{N}{PB} + \log_dP (\frac{N}{PB} + d\log P))\]\end{thm}

We need to consider a good value for $d$ to get something $O(N/(PB) \log _{M/B}N/B)$.


We needed the following assumptions on $d$
\begin{enumerate}
\item Number of splits requires: $d\geq x^2$
\item $d\leq M/B$
\item Sorting pivots requires: 

\[\frac{Cd\log N}{B} \log _{M/B} \frac{Cd\log N}{B} \leq \frac{N}{PB}\]

which is equivalent to

\[d\leq \frac{N}{P\log N \cdot \log_{M/B} N/B}\]
\item $d\leq \frac{N}{PB \log P}$
\end{enumerate}

We set $d$ to be the minimum of the upper bounds. Then we get

\[\frac{N}{PB}(\log_{M/B} \frac{N}{PB} + \log d P)\]

\begin{thm} If $P\leq \min(\frac{N}{x^2\log^2N}, \sqrt{\frac{N}{x^2B}})$, and $\log_d P = O(\ldots)$, then the complexity is 

\[O(\frac{N}{PB} \log_{M/B} \frac{N}{B})\]
