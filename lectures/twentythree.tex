\section{Breadth-First Search}

Recall the sequential version of BFS

\begin{lstlisting}
BFS(s)
Q = {s}
s is reached
do 
	$L_{next}$ = $\emptyset$
	for all $v\in Q$
		do for all vertices $u$ adjacent to $v$
			if $u$ unreached
				$L_{next}$ += u
				u becomes reached
	Q = $L_{next}$
until $Q=\emptyset$
\end{lstlisting}

In external memory we have the graph as an array $V$ of pointers into the array of edges $E$ such that $V[i]$ points to the list of adjacent edges of node $i$.

Iterating over the adjacent edges of $v$ takes $O(1+\deg(v)/B)$ IOs. Checking if $u$ is reached takes an IO too. So this takes $O(n+m)$ IOs in the worst case.
